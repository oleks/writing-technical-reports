\subsection{Evaluation}

\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section you should evaluate your work and give a quality assessment of
your implementation. Discuss the running time and space complexity of the
algorithms you used. Discuss the quality of your code and documentation.
Discuss the technical debt. Is it maintainable? Is it ready to meet the
end-user?

An essential part of software evaluation is \textbf{testing}: Give an overview
of what you thought was relevant to test in the context of the problem. Give a
high-level overview of the tests you conducted, and present your test results.
Discuss your test results, what do they show?  Employ the scientific method in
your quality assessment: tell the reader how to reproduce your test results.
