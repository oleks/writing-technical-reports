\subsection{User's Guide and/or Examples}

\label{sec:users-guide-and-examples}

This section should target the readers less interested in extending,
or integrating your application, but more interested in \emph{using}
it to solve the problem motivated in your introduction. Do not assume
that the reader has read the background, analysis, and design
sections. Tell the reader how to run your program, and showcase some
examples.

Depending on the context of your report, an outright ``user's guide''
might not be relevant, but it is always a good idea to showcase that
your program works for some sample instances of the problem.
