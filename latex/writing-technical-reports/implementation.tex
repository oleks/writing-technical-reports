\subsection{Implementation}

\label{sec:implementation}

This is the part where you delve into low-level implementation details. Discuss
the concrete implementations of your algorithms and data structures. Discuss
the low-level challenges you faced, and how you addressed them.

Your discussion should suffice for another programmer to pick up your
program and run with it.

Although you \emph{can} include parts of your code here, code is better
included as part of the appendices to your report. Refer to the relevant parts
of your appendices from here.
