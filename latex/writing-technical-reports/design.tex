\subsection{Design}

\label{sec:design}

In this section you should give a high-level overview of your
solution, and argue why you chose this design over others. You should
use high-level notation, without delving into implementation details.
For instance, draw diagrams over the essential elements of your
solution (e.g., using UML and entity-relation diagrams), give abstract
descriptions and illustrations of the data structures, and present
pseudo-code for the algorithms you used. Contrast this with other
possible architectures, data structures, and algorithms.
