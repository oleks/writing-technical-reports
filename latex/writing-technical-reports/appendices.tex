\subsection{Appendices}

\label{sec:appendices}

Your report should not be too long, and should include little code. The report
is supposed to give an overview the code alone cannot provide. Appendices are a
good place to actually list your code, list long-winded test results, and
include sections which go beyond the scope of your report.

When including source code, use proper source code listings: \textbf{do not use
screen shots}. Screen shots cut in the eye of the reader, and make your code
non-selectable, and non-copy/paste-able. All this impedes communication of
code. (When using \LaTeX, we can recommend using the \texttt{listings} package,
or the \texttt{minted} package together with the \texttt{Pygments} Python
package).
