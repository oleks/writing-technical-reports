\subsection{Background}

\label{sec:background}

This section serves to fill the gap between what you expect of your
readers, and what they need to know to understand your solution. In a
longer report, it can be a good idea to state your target audience in
the introductory matters. In a shorter report, you can assume that the
reader is mildly familiar with your programming task, and the context
of your work.

Show your understanding of the main elements of the problem, and what
goes into making a solution. For instance, if you are tasked with
writing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, this is a good point to recap the rules
of the game.
