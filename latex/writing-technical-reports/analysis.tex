\subsection{Analysis}

\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, you should show that you understand the problem and
how to solve it. The outcome of this section should be some goals for
your design, and requirements for your implementation. It is at this
point that we narrow in what sort of technology we will need to make a
working solution.

For instance, if you are writing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, explain how
you intend for users to interact with the game, and what constitutes a
game-frame, in a bullet-point list.
